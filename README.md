# SokobanGameCPP
# Building
The project is configured for x64 Release mode.
If you have trouble building, double check that you are building for x64 Release.

This game is unfinished but it's an interesting demo. I worked hard on it so I've decied to leave it up.
Notable features (varying levels of polish): tilemap editor, dialogue sytem, basic sokoban mechanics, and some fun art :)
